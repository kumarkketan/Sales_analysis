In this project, I worked with three related datasets — Sales, Customers, and Products — to clean, prepare, and store the data for analysis. The goal was to make the data structured and reliable so it could be used for insights, reporting, and dashboards.

I started with raw CSV files and used Python for cleaning, then moved everything into a MySQL database with proper relationships and structure.

🧹 What I Did in Python

  • Opened and explored the datasets using Pandas

  • Fixed missing values and cleaned up messy data like inconsistent date formats, price fields, and customer names

  • Used regex to remove special characters and clean text fields

  • Renamed and formatted columns to make them easier to work with

  • Standardized dates and cleaned up numeric columns like prices and discounts

  • Exported the cleaned data for use in MySQL

🗃️ Work Done in MySQL

  • Created structured tables for Sales, Customers, and Products

  • Set up primary keys and used foreign keys to connect the tables

  • Added a new column based on two existing columns to support future analysis (feature engineering)

  • Focused on keeping the database clean, connected, and easy to query

💡 Key Skills & Concepts Used

  • Data cleaning with Pandas and NumPy

  • String and text processing using Regex

  • SQL database design with relationships

  • Creating new columns (features) from existing data

  • Preparing data for dashboards and reporting

  • Understanding how to handle real-world messy data

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

  • Python (Pandas, NumPy, Regex)

  • MySQL

  • SQLAlchemy

  • Jupyter Notebook

✅ Final Output

By the end of this project, I had a clean, connected database that’s ready for analysis. It can be used for tracking sales performance, understanding customer behavior, and analyzing product trends — all essential parts of a sales dashboard. Dashboard work is still in progress.
